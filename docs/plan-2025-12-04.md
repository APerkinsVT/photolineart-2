# PhotoLineArt – Near-Term Polish & Growth Plan (2025-12-04)

## What will make the app sing
- Instant clarity: “Upload → see line art + palette → download in under a minute.” Keep the hero CTA; add a tiny 1-2-3 visual near the form so newcomers know what happens.
- Delight in results: Show the user’s custom title prominently. Let line art + palette feel like a personal mini-gallery. Add a tap-to-zoom (modal/lightbox) for the line art before download.
- Confidence & privacy: Keep “we delete originals” visible near download. Add a subtle checkmark when deletion completes—this is a differentiator.
- One-tap sharing & proof: After download, surface “Share your page” plus a few real user comments/ratings. A live counter (“pages made today”) can make it feel active.
- Guided next step: If rating is 4–5, nudge to try a second photo or the multi-photo book. If rating is low, invite quick feedback with a single-question form.
- Paid tier preview: Tease “Upload up to 10 photos → printable book + portal link.” Show a sample spread.
- Performance & polish: Fast initial load, clear progress states, zero dead time.
- Retention hooks: Email includes link back, palette, deletion note. Add “Start another page” link in the email.
- Accessibility/mobile: Large tap targets, readable text, smooth scroll to results after upload.

## Next-sprint shortlist (suggested)
1) Lightbox/zoom for line art preview.
2) Deletion confirmation checkmark near download.
3) Post-rating nudges (4–5 stars → try another / book; low rating → quick feedback).
4) Small “book preview” teaser panel on landing.
5) Optional: live counter (“pages made today”) and short 1-2-3 visual near the form.

## Monitoring/UX checks
- Keep an eye on Vercel logs for 502s; consider retry button for failures.
- Confirm GA events: rating_submit, downloads.
- Ensure deletion call success is visible (or logged) so users feel their privacy is respected.

## Longer-term
- Paid tier flow: multi-photo upload → book PDF + portal persistence + QR return link. Align styling with the polished single-photo flow.
- Inline feedback form (contact) instead of mailto, when we’re ready.
